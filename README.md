# Noyou

Noyou is an App that lets you manage shopping and todo lists with multiple people. It is made with React Native and communicates through sockets with a Node Server. Data is stored in a Google Firebase Database. This Readme describes how to set up the App for yourself.

Please note that this is passion/practice project that I made for my girlfriend and myself so I did not bother with an account managing system. All list entries  are public to all users of the same Server and Database.
